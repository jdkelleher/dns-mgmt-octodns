# Manage DNS as code with [OctoDNS](https://github.com/octodns/octodns).

OctoDNS is a very elegant infrastructure as code tool for managing DNS. This repo is used to manage several domains and can be forked and configured to manage others.

This repo is configured to automatically push sync zone changes to DNS providers after pull requests are approved in GitHub. Zone changes can also be pushed manually from a local copy of the repo.

OctoDNS is written in Python and make is used to manage the virtual environment, dependencies, and zone change actions.
